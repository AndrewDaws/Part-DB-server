# Upgrade from Part-DB 1.x to 2.x

Part-DB 2.0 is a major release that changes a lot of things internally, but it is still compatible with Part-DB 1.x.
Depending on your preferences, you will have to do some changes to your Part-DB installation, this document will guide
you through the upgrade process.

## New requirements
*If you are running Part-DB inside a docker container, you can skip this section, as the new requirements are already
fulfilled by the official Part-DB docker image.*

Part-DB 2.0 requires at least PHP 8.2 (newer versions are recommended). So if your existing Part-DB installation is still
running PHP 8.1, you will have to upgrade your PHP version first.
The minimum required version of node.js is now 20.0 or newer, so if you are using 18.0, you will have to upgrade it too.

Most distributions should have the possibility to get backports for PHP 8.4 and modern nodejs, so you should be able to
easily upgrade your system to the new requirements. Otherwise, you can use the official Part-DB docker image, which
ships all required dependencies and is always up to date with the latest requirements, so that you do not have to worry
about the requirements at all.
